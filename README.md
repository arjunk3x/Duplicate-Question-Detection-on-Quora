Duplicate Question Detection on Quora
This repository hosts a Duplicate Question Detection framework developed to identify duplicate questions on Quora using machine learning techniques. Duplicate question detection plays a crucial role in improving the quality of content and user experience on question-and-answer platforms like Quora.

Key Features:
Binary Classification Algorithms: The framework employs binary classification algorithms such as logistic regression and ensemble methodologies like random forest to distinguish between duplicate and non-duplicate questions effectively.

Text Preprocessing Pipelines: Orchestrated text preprocessing pipelines are implemented, incorporating advanced techniques including text vectorization, stopword elimination, and lemmatization. These pipelines utilize prominent libraries such as scikit-learn, Gensim, and NLTK to ensure the quality and consistency of textual data.

Comprehensive Performance Evaluations: Extensive performance evaluations of machine learning models are conducted, employing diverse vectorization methodologies such as TF-IDF and Word2Vec. This facilitates the identification of optimal model configurations for maximal efficacy in duplicate question detection.
